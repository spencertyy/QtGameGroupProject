## Project Description
## Sprint 1
- A user should be able to sign up, sign in or play as guest.
- In the Sign up form, the user is asked to enter their: first name, last name, date of birth, gender (optional), profile picture, username and password.
The username is a unique identifier.
- When the user logs in, their name and profile picture, and the current date should be displayed.
- If the date is the user's birthday, the application should send a birthday greetings.
- The user should be able to view the history of the scores of the game(s) they previously played. The score should be compared to the global best score.
- The password should consist of at least 8 characters and contain at least one number, upper and lower case letters.
## Sprint 2
- Build on assignment 2 (collecting water droplets).
- Add a counter (Number of collected water droplets) and a score (points).
- The player must collect 150 points to win the game, each droplet is worth 5 points. 
- The player looses if 5 water droplets are missed.
- The rolling speed of the water droplet starts slowly. The speed is doubled after collecting 5 droplets. For instance, if the starting speed is 1x, the - - speed becomes 2x after collecting 5 droplets, then 4x after collecting 10 droplets and so on. The speed should not exceed 16x.
- Add sound effects when collecting a droplet and another sound when a droplet is missed.
- Add game level (Easy, Medium, Hard) which can be selected before starting a game. Level can be considered in terms of droplet speed.
